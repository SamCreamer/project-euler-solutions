These are some of the solutions I used for the Project Euler problems at projecteuler.net. I wrote these in python because it's fast to type these scripts and test different algorithms.

The solutions in the `python` folder were done in Python 2. Of course, the solutions in the `python3` folder were done in Python 3.
